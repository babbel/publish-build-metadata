# publish-build-metadata

Internal Babbel tool to collect build artifacts metadata.

## Usage

In your project workflow, after build artifact was published.

All `AWS_` secrets should be already set and ready to use.

### Standalone project example

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  name_of_the_job:
    #
    # ...
    #
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ vars.AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION }}
      #
      # ... build & publish the artifact
      #
      - uses: babbel/publish-build-metadata@v1
        with:
          meta_table_arn: ${{ vars.AWS_META_TABLE_ARN }}
```

### Microverse example, all slices at once

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  name_of_the_job:
    #
    # ...
    #
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ vars.AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION }}
      #
      # ... build & publish the artifact
      #
      - uses: babbel/publish-build-metadata@v1
        with:
          meta_table_arn: ${{ vars.AWS_META_TABLE_ARN }}
          slices: 'api, consumer.kinesis, consumer.firehose'
```

### Microverse example, one slice at a time

For example in case you have jobs matrix.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  name_of_the_job:
    #
    # ...
    #
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ vars.AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION }}
      #
      # ... build & publish the artifact
      #
      - uses: babbel/publish-build-metadata@v1
        with:
          meta_table_arn: ${{ vars.AWS_META_TABLE_ARN }}
          slices: 'api' # or ${{ matrix.function_name }}
```

### When custom Commit SHA

Sometimes you might trigger an automatic build which fetches a different branch. In such case `GITHUB_SHA` differs from actual Commit SHA that the build is working on.

In such case you can override `GITHUB_SHA` by passing extra parameter:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  name_of_the_job:
    #
    # ...
    #
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ vars.AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION }}
      #
      # ... build & publish the artifact
      #
      - uses: babbel/publish-build-metadata@v1
        with:
          meta_table_arn: ${{ vars.AWS_META_TABLE_ARN }}
          sha: ${{ env.MY_CUSTOM_COMMIT_SHA }}
```

Usually with above it will be handy to be able to specify the branch name as well, so the full example would look like:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  name_of_the_job:
    #
    # ...
    #
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ vars.AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION }}
      #
      # ... build & publish the artifact
      #
      - uses: babbel/publish-build-metadata@v1
        with:
          meta_table_arn: ${{ vars.AWS_META_TABLE_ARN }}
          sha: ${{ env.MY_CUSTOM_COMMIT_SHA }}
          branch: ${{ env.MY_CUSTOM_BRANCH }}
```

### PR-triggered workflows

For [PR-triggered workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request), the branch (`GITHUB_REF`) and commit (`GITHUB_SHA`) which will be deployed are the PR merge branch (e.g `refs/pull/123/merge`) and the last merge commit on the `GITHUB_REF` branch respectively. This merge commit is auto-generated by Github and has the following format:

```Merge 51a13eb7fad0401d4ef5d01a98c729c7e231fe8e into 912858b8fb3fc0318a892b1b7e69ee72592717bb (388611d)```.

In order to display a more meaningful commit message in the Deploy App, a `commit_message_sha` input may be provided.

**NB: This `commit_message_sha` input is purely for display purposes in the Deploy App. The commit which will be deployed remains the GITHUB_SHA commit on the GITHUB_REF branch.**

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  name_of_the_job:
    #
    # ...
    #
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          role-to-assume: ${{ vars.AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN }}
          aws-region: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION }}
      #
      # ... build & publish the artifact
      #
      - uses: babbel/publish-build-metadata@v1
        with:
          meta_table_arn: ${{ vars.AWS_META_TABLE_ARN }}
          commit_message_sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}
```

## Contribute

Prep the project, it runs against nodejs v20, when using `asdf-vm` just hit `asdf install`. Then install the packages

```
npm ci
```

Run the tests

```
make test
```

Or better run the whole build all the time, this way you won't forget to run it before commit

```
make build
```
